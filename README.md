# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Cannot read properties of undefined

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications, specifically the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'message')".  The error occurs when attempting to access a property of an object that is undefined.

## Problem
The `pages/about.js` component attempts to access `data.message`, but the `data` prop is not defined, leading to the runtime error.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a check to ensure that `data` and its `message` property are defined before accessing them. This can be achieved using optional chaining (?.) and the nullish coalescing operator (??).

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.  You will see the error.

## How to fix
